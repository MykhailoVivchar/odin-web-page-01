Creating a project is close to design, but don't worry about making it perfect. Don't get out a ruler and count pixels to find the exact margins between different sections.

The point of this task is to create something from scratch and put the various elements in more or less the correct position relative to the rest. It doesn't matter if you use margin: 24px when the design actually has margin: 40px.
